# Issue Format

It is very important to make a clear and concise issue to make it easy to fix, We require these things in every issue.

1) Where this bug is found. Ingame, online, etc. (Note, if the bug is a missing URL, it is technically online, but report how you got to the link)

2) A screenshot showing the bug. The *entire* minecraft/web browser screen is needed. Feel free to cover any info you don't want revealed. Usually only a screenshot is needed and no other info is needed, but fill out the rest anyway.

3) A _brief_ explaination of the bug. I want it brief, if you can describe the issue to your dad without him being confused, it's more than enough for me.

4) Steps to reproduce the bug (i.e. how you got the bug)

The rest are just "survey" questions and do not need to be answered.

5) What is your MC IGN?

6) How did you come across the bug? Were you searching for it?
